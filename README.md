 ABSTRACT
 
The expansion of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms into diverse decision-making processes has brought a growing impact of algorithmic decisions on peopleâ€™s lives. This, in turn, has amplified the potential for unintended biases embedded in these algorithms to manifest. These biases can lead to unfair discrimination, or exacerbate existing inequalities among various groups, raising concerns in social, ethical, and legal realms. Therefore, data bias must be carefully considered, particularly in fields that heavily utilize human data.
This paper addresses these critical issues by presenting a comprehensive framework for detecting, handling, and mitigating bias within the context of ML model development, specifically for healthcare applications. Conducting an extensive background analysis, the paper explores the sources of bias and their implications in the healthcare ML development cycle and introduces methods to handle and quantify unfairness using definitions and programming tools. The study also provides empirical findings from healthcare predicting modeling 1, spotlighting biases in ML algorithm performance, particularly in the presence of imbalanced data. Through experimentation with various bias mitigation approaches, further assisted by xAI tools, the research emphasized the pivotal role of tailored data engineering during the pre-processing phase in effectively mitigating bias, especially within healthcare datasets. The objective is to achieve equitable predictions and outcomes for all patient groups.
The study underscores the critical need for investing in case-specific data engineering strategies and advocates for the availability of more diverse and open-source healthcare datasets, encompassing a broad range of patient attributes. This call for action aims to foster fairness and transparency in healthcare predictive modeling, ensuring ML algorithms contribute to equitable healthcare outcomes and decision-making processes.
